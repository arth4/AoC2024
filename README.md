# AoC2024
advent of code 2024 with arbitrary rules

(rules don't apply to input preparation (within reason))

- ‚≠ê‚≠ê [Day 1](https://github.com/arth4/AoC2024/blob/master/aoc1.ipynb) - numpy funcs only: no ifs, loops         
- ‚≠ê‚¨õ [Day 2](https://github.com/arth4/AoC2024/blob/master/aoc2.ipynb) - numpy funcs only: no ifs, loops         
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê [Day 3](https://github.com/arth4/AoC2024/blob/master/aoc3.ipynb) - regex and str.find is banned!            
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê [Day 4](https://github.com/arth4/AoC2024/blob/master/aoc4.ipynb) - Use scipy's 2d convolution for wordsearch            
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê [Day 5](https://github.com/arth4/AoC2024/blob/master/aoc5.ipynb) - numpy funcs only..., cheated a bit (used def + apply_along). Cheesed part 2 üòè.        
- ‚≠ê‚¨õ [Day 6](https://github.com/arth4/AoC2024/blob/master/aoc6.ipynb) - No rules! but the output must be beautiful!‚ú®‚ú®         
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê [Day 7](https://github.com/arth4/AoC2024/blob/master/aoc7.ipynb) - FUNctional programming
